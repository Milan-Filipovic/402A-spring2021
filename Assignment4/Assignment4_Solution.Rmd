Mean and proportions are two of the most important parameters in statistics because they arise frequently in life:

+ What proportion of patients benefit from a drug?
+ Is the C-section proportion the same for white women and black women who give birth?
+ What is the probability a person is a carrier of a rare genetic defect? 


We model $Y_i$ as a Binomial random variable with batch size $m_i$ and "success" probability $p_i$
$$
\mathbb{P}(Y_i = y_i) = \binom{m_i}{y_i} p_i^{y_i} (1 - p_i)^{m_i - y_i}.
$$
Where $E(Y_i)=np$ and $Var(Y_i)=np(1-p)$. 

Suppose we want to compare two different proportions $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$. Recall the basic formula for calculating sample size:
$$
n=\frac{16}{\Delta^2}
$$
Belle proposes the following rule of thumb for calculating binomial sample size:
$$
n=\frac{16\bar{\pi}(1-\bar{\pi})}{(\pi_0-\pi_1)^2}
$$
Where $\bar{\pi}=\frac{(\pi_0+\pi_1)}{2}$ is used as the average variance of the two proportions. 

## Discussion and Extension

This approximation is good for values of n that come out between 10 and 100. More exact formulas should be used to determine sample sizes for values of n outside of this range.
